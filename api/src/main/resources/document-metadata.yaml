      Program curriculum including admission requirements, placement tests, remedial courses,
      learning outcomes, and program objectives.

      There is also a study plan guide, where the courses are places in semesters, used as a guide for when to take the courses.

      The year of a study plan represents the first student cohort it serves, and remains in effect
      for later cohorts unless superseded by a newer study plan.
