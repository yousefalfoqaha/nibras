      Program curriculum including admission requirements, placement tests, remedial courses,
      learning outcomes, and program objectives.

      Can be split into different tracks, requiring different courses and electives.

      Includes categorizing courses into sections of different levels (university, school, program), and type (compulsory, elective), usually named the 'framework'.

      There is also a study plan guide, where the courses are places in semesters, used as a guide for when to take the courses in an appropriate sequence.

      The year of a study plan represents the first student cohort it serves, and remains in effect
      for later cohorts unless superseded by a newer study plan.
